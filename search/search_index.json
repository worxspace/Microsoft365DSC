Microsoft365DSC has to adapt to these changes and at the same time make sure existing users and configurations are impacted as little as possible. That is why starting in 2021, we are adopting a formal process to handle breaking changes. The goal of this process is to provide a clear schedule, so that users of Microsoft365DSC are aware of any impact, any required actions and prepare themselves well in advance. What are Breaking Changes? \u00b6 In the cases where a new resource is added, a resource gets a new optional parameter or a parameter that used to be mandatory becomes optional, existing configurations are not impacted. But when a resource or parameter is removed or an optional parameter becomes mandatory, existing configurations can stop functioning, because they are using these removed components. That is what is called a \u201cBreaking Change\u201d: A change that can break existing configurations and therefore impact the administration process of Microsoft 365. Release process \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC relies on multiple other modules for connecting to Microsoft 365, which all can release updates at any time. If a change in any of these modules is released which results in a breaking change in Microsoft365DSC, we will update the module to write a verbose message notifying the administrator that the component (resource, parameter, etc) has become deprecated, is no longer being used and will be removed in a future version. A warning event will also be added to the event logs, allowing users to monitor deprecated events. Twice a year we will release a version that bundles all breaking changes of the previous six months into a single version: The first release of the month in April and October. The release notes of these versions will have all breaking changes clearly documented, including the required actions to take. While it is still our recommendation to always use the latest version of the module for your operations, Breaking Changes Releases (BCR) will almost certainly mean that you will have to update your existing configurations or generate a new export. We understand that this may introduce challenges to our users which is why every BCR will be properly communicated and detailed information about how to address these breaking changes will be published in advanced on the official GitHub repository. NOTE: Since releases are cumulative, all releases after that version will also have those changes included and will require the same updates to existing configurations.","title":"Breaking Changes Policy"},{"location":"concepts/consent-flow/","text":"Consent flow \u00b6 After installing the Microsoft365DSC PowerShell modules, you have to consent the various modules to successfully use Microsoft365DSC. The PnP and the Microsoft Graph modules require some setting up before using. PnP PowerShell \u00b6 When using PnP PowerShell for the first time you have to consent the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant Azure AD Application via the following cmdlet: Register-PnPManagementShellAccess Microsoft Graph \u00b6 For the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module you need to specify scopes to make sure you can export the different modules. We made this a lot easier for you with the Get-M365DSCCompiledPermissionList cmdlet. You can enter the module you want to export and it will return the correct scope. For instance, when you want to export the AADTenantDetails module, you can use the following example to get the correct scope(s). Get-M365DSCCompiledPermissionList -ResourceNameList @( \"AADTenantDetails\" ) This will give you the following response: Name Value ---- ----- ReadPermissions { Organization . Read . All } UpdatePermissions { Organization . ReadWrite . All }","title":"Consent Flow"},{"location":"concepts/odsp-permissions/","text":"Microsoft365DSC Permissions for SharePoint and OneDrive \u00b6 The latest version of Microsoft365DSC support both user and AzureAD App principal authentication. It is recommended to use AzureAD app authentication for several reasons. The first is that when granting permission to the AAD App it will ensure it has permissions to all SharePoint and OneDrive resources. The second reason is that most organizations enforce MFA authentication on user account that have roles assigned to them. This will cause issues when monitoring or apply changes to SharePoint or OneDrive as it will prompt for MFA numerous times. AzureAD app and user based authentication both can have passwords stored in compiled MOF files so ensure the are secured. Please refer to following video User based authentication \u00b6 When using a user account with Microsoft365DSC make sure the account is a cloud only user account for example admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com. Microsoft365DSC uses account name for determining tenant within the resources so using federate accounts may cause issue when running Microsoft365DSC. Roles and permissions \u00b6 When using user based authentication several of the resources do support the Global reader role. The following resources support global reader: SPOApp SPOSearchManagedProperty SPOSearchResultSource SPOStorageEntity SPOTenantCdnEnabled SPOTenantCdnPolicy SPOUserProfileProperty All SharePoint and OneDrive resources work with the SharePoint Admin role assigned. The SPOSiteGroup resource will error if the account doesn't have site collection admin permissions even if account is has the role of SharePoint admin. This is why we recommend using AAD App permissions. This role does provide full control so it can also be used for pushing configurations to your tenant. Lastly using an account that has Global Admin permissions typically permissions to entire tenant and can be used on all SharePoint and OneDrive resources. When executing the Export-M365DSCConfiguration cmdlet user name and password should be filled in the following fields: Azure AD app permissions \u00b6 The best option when using Microsoft365DSC with SharePoint and OneDrive is to use an Azure AD app principal. When using AAD App permission Microsoft365DSC supports 2 different scenarios, certificate path option or installing certificate and using the thumbprint. The permissions required for Azure AD applications are SharePoint Site.FullControl.All scope. Configure AzureAD app for Microsoft365DSC \u00b6 The SharePoint PNP team created a cmdlet that simplifies the setup of AzureAD App called Initialize-PNPPowerShellAuthentication . The following script can be used to create the AzureAD app permissions needed for Microsoft365DSC Initialize-PnPPowerShellAuthentication -ApplicationName TestApp2 -Tenant contoso . onmicrosoft . com -OutPath c :\\ DSC -CertificatePassword ( ConvertTo-SecureString -String \"password\" -AsPlainText -Force ) -store CurrentUser -scopes \"SPO.Sites.FullControl.All\" This cmdlet will open a dialog box to authenticate to Azure AD and grant admin consent once its created the AzureAD app. It will also install the certificate in current user store and output a PFX file in the c:\\dsc directory. If you plan to use the certificate thumbprint option when using DSC by default the LCM runs under the system account so easiest option to install in cert store is by using PSExec . To install certificate under system account using PSExec run the following: 1. .\\PsExec.exe -s -i mmc.exe 2. File add / remove snapin > Select certificates > MyUser account 3. Open Certificate - Current User and select Personal 4. Select import certificate and browse to location from outpath in code from above and select the PFX file After AzureAD app is created and certificate is installed you need some additional properties before you can use with Microsoft365DSC. Login to Azure Active Directory and browse to the App registrations page you should see the TestApp2 app created from the script above. We need to copy the following properties: Using Certificate Thumbprint option \u00b6 When running the export or creating configuration files for resources the following are the required parameters for authentication when using certificate thumbprint. * ApplicationID * TenantID - This must be in format of contoso.onmicrosoft.com * CertificateThumbprint From the Export-M365DSCConfiguration GUI the following fields should be used: Using Certificate Path option \u00b6 There are times when using Microsoft365DSC you may need to use the certificate path option. For example using Azure DevOps to monitor tenant for configuration drift you would not have access to install certificates on the build agents. In this scenario using the certificate path option would be the best solution. The following parameters are required when using certificate path: * ApplicationID * TenantID - this must be in format of contoso.onmicrosoft.com * CertificatePath - this is path to the PFX certificate on local machine ex: c:\\dsc\\testapp2.pfx * CertificatePassword - password for certificate From the Export-M365DSCConfiguration GUI the following fields should be used:","title":"OneDrive & SharePoint Permissions"},{"location":"contributing/contribution-guidelines/","text":"Contribution guidelines \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC is an Open-Source initiative lead by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community and open for new ideas as well as for volunteers helping us make it even better and better.

Select the Resource to Add \u00b6 DSC resources need to support CRUD operations, meaning that we need to be able to read them, create (or set) instances of them, update them and sometimes remove them. In that regards, your first step in selecting a resource to add should be to make sure there are associated PowerShell cmdlets (or APIs) available to support your resource. For example, the SCComplianceCase resource has the following cmdlets available in the Security and Compliance Powershell module: New-ComplianceCase , Set-ComplianceCase , Get-ComplianceCase and Remove-ComplianceCase . It is therefore a candidate to be added as a resource to the project. A few rules also apply to your resource selection: * For SharePoint Online, where possible, prioritize using the PnP module over the Microsoft.Online.SharePoint.PowerShell one. We are slowly transitioning over an exclusive use of the PnP module and will eventually phase out the use of the SharePoint Online Management Shell. Some cmdlets in the Exchange and Security and Compliance modules are only available to certain SKUs, you will need to make sure that executing a configuration that uses your resource against a SKU that doesn\u2019t support its underlying cmdlets or API is gracefully handled, and does not throw a blocking error. Create the Resource Files \u00b6 The best way to get started here is to simply copy and existing resource, and then to rename and modify it. All resources are found under /Modules/Microsoft365DSC/DSCResources . Each resource is represented by a folder, a .psm1 file which contains the logic of the resource, a .schema.mof file which is a class defining the properties of the resource as well as with a readme.md file which describes what the resource is for. The Folder, module and schema files need to be named based on the following pattern: - Need to start with MSFT_ to indicate that this is for a project under the Microsoft organization. - Need to then contain letters representing the workload associated to the resource (EXO for Exchange Online, SPO for SharePoint Online, OD for OneDrive, SC for Security and Compliance, TEAMS for teams, and O365 for generic admin resources). - The rest of the name should normally follow the same naming convention as the cmdlet it represents. For example, because the cmdlet to create a new compliance case is New-ComplianceCase, the associated resource would be named MSFT_SCComplianceCase . Start with the Parameters \u00b6 Now that you've identified what resource you wish to work on, take a look at the documentation for the associated cmdlets or APIs. For example, the MSFT_SCComplianceCase cmdlet information is found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/exchange/policy-and-compliance-ediscovery/new-compliancecase?view=exchange-ps . Take a look at the list of parameters and figure out which one should be implemented by your resource. For the Compliance Case example, the documentation lists the following properties: New-ComplianceCase [ -Name ] String [ -Confirm ] [ -Description ] String [ -DomainController ] FQDN [ -Sources ] Object [] [ -WhatIf ] [CommonParameters] Some of these parameters can be ignored since they do not make sense to implement in a resource or for Office 365 altogether. From the list of parameters above, we can see that parameter Name should be our key indicator. We can also see that we won't need to implement the Confirm, WhatIf and CommonParameters properties in our resources since they don't make sense in the context of DSC. On top of that, if we read through the documentation, we can see that the DomainController and Sources properties are reserved for internal Microsoft use. Therefore we won't be implementing them within our resource. The list of parameters is not yet complete at this point. If we take a look at the update cmdlet Set-ComplianceCase , we can see from its documentation that it accepts a -Close and -Reopen property to define if a case is opened or closed. We will add this property to our resource as Status and will accept Active or Closed as values. We now need to write the list of parameters our Get, Set, and Test functions will accept. Note that the list of parameters for these three functions need to be exactly the same otherwise the resource validation will fail. In the Compliance Case example, the properties will translate to the following: [ Parameter ( Mandatory = $true )] [System.String] $Name , [ Parameter ()] [System.String] $Description , [ Parameter ()] [ ValidateSet ( \"Active\" , \"Closed\" )] [System.String] $Status = \"Active\" On top of these resources specific parameters, each resource should define the Ensure when they support removing instances of the resource. Every resource is also required to define the GlobalAdminAccount . By adding these two additional properties, the function signature of our resource then becomes: function Get | Set | Test-TargetResource [ CmdletBinding ()] [ OutputType ([ Hashtable | void | Boolean ])] param ( [ Parameter ( Mandatory = $true )] [System.String] $Name , [ Parameter ()] [System.String] $Description , [ Parameter ()] [ ValidateSet ( \"Active\" , \"Closed\" )] [System.String] $Status = \"Active\" , [ Parameter ()] [ ValidateSet ( 'Present' , 'Absent' )] [System.String] $Ensure = 'Present' , [ Parameter ( Mandatory = $true )] [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential] $GlobalAdminAccount ) Microsoft365DSC also supports ReverseDSC natively, which means that it needs to define a fourth function named Export-TargetResource in each resources. This function should only ever accept the GlobalAdminAccount property. The logic of this function should loop through each instances of your resources in the tenant, and convert them into DSC strings. Please refer to existing resources to better understand the logic of this function. Define the Schema \u00b6 Next is the schema file where we will define what properties are expected by our resources in the public scope. You need to make sure you clearly identify the requirement type of each parameter in our resources. These can be: Key : Represents a unique identifier of the resource. There can be more than one key parameter for your resource. Any given configuration cannot define duplicates of the same instance of key parameters. These need to be unique inside a node in your configuration. Required : Represents a property that is mandatory. These are not primary keys and can have duplicate values inside your configuration. Write : Represents optional properties. Some properties can also define a restricted set of accepted values. These can be identified as ValueMap in the parameter definition (see example below). You will also need to provide a description for each parameter. Ideally you should simply copy the description of the property from the official documentation on docs.microsoft.com . If we take our previous example, the schema file for our MSFT_SCComplianceCase resource would become: [ ClassVersion ( \"1.0.0.0\" ), FriendlyName ( \"SCComplianceCase\" )] class MSFT_SCComplianceCase : OMI_BaseResource { [ Key , Description ( \"The Name parameter specifies the unique name of the compliance case.\" )] String Name ; [ Write , Description ( \"The description of the case.\" )] String Description ; [ Write , Description ( \"Specify if this case should exist or not.\" ), ValueMap { \"Present\" , \"Absent\" }, Values { \"Present\" , \"Absent\" }] String Ensure ; [ Write , Description ( \"Status for the case. Can either be 'Active' or 'Closed'\" ), ValueMap { \"Active\" , \"Closed\" }, Values { \"Active\" , \"Closed\" }] String Status ; [ Required , Description ( \"Credentials of the Global Admin Account\" ), EmbeddedInstance ( \"MSFT_Credential\" )] String GlobalAdminAccount ; }; From the example above, note that the class name reflects the full resource name with the MSFT_ prefix. We are however defining a friendly name in the metadata. This should only reflect the short name (without prefix) of the resource. This will allow us to use this alias within our configurations to represent the resource.","title":"Develop a New Resource"},{"location":"contributing/getting-started/","text":"Setting up your Environment to Contribute to the Project \u00b6 The Microsoft365DSC project is open to contribution from the community. In order to contribute to it, you are expected to have some basic level of knowledge of how GitHub works. This wiki page tries to simplify the process of contributing back to the project by providing you with a step-by-step process. Fork the base repository Navigate to the main repository page of the Microsoft365DSC project (e.g. https://GitHub.com/Microsoft/Microsoft365DSC); In the top right corner of the page, click on the Fork button; A dialog box asking you to select the account to fork the repository will appear. Select you account from the list. The forking process should only take a few seconds. While the forking is in progress you will see the following screen. Once completed, you have now a completely forked repository, meaning you have an exact replica of the main repository, under you own GitHub account. The changes you will be working on, will be done in this new forked repository. Once you are satisfied with your changes, they can be submitted back to the owners of the main Module repository via what we call a Pull Request (covered later in this post). Create a Feature Branch Creating a Fork is the equivalent of creating a separate workspace for you to start working on your changes. What we need to do now, is create a new Branch inside that Fork. Think of a branch as being a project within your workspace. Every feature or issue you work on should be in its own branch. By default, when you forked the main repository, you created a copy of the Dev repository from the main repository, inside your fork. Every branch you create in your fork, will essentially be a copy of that Forked Dev branch. Let's put all this in context: **Main Repository** **Forked Repository** Branches: Branches: - Dev - Dev --> Feature 1 --> Feature 2 --> ... In the example above, Feature 1 and Feature 2 are both branches that were created from the Dev branch of the Forked Repository. In order to submit the changes in Feature 1 back into the Main Repository, you will need to first create a Pull Request to have Feature 1 merged back into the Dev branch of your Forked Repository, and then once done, create yet another Pull Request to merge the Forked Repository's Dev branch (which now includes the changes for Feature 1) back in the Main Repository's Dev branch. To create a branch, navigate to the main page of your Forked Repository, and click on the Branch button. The next step is not intuitive, but to create a new branch, simply start typing the name of the new branch you wish to create and press enter. This will automatically create the branch inside your Forked Repository. In order to validate that you are currently viewing file from the branch you just created, you should now see the Branch button listing the newly created branch on the Forked Repository's home page. Cloning the Forked Repository In GitHub, cloning is the process of \"downloading\" the content of a branch onto your local machine for editing. My recommendation here will be to download and install the GitHub client for Windows https://desktop.github.com/. It just makes things a lot easier than having to deal with the console Git client (or even the VSCode built-in tools for that matter). Open GitHub for Windows, and select File > Clone Repository... . In the Clone a Repository dialogue, select the URL tab and provide the URL to your Forked Repository, as well as a local path where the content of the repository is going to be downloaded locally. Click on the Clone button. Wait for the cloning to finish. You now have a local copy of the repository on your local machine. Changing Branches Once you have cloned the Forked Repository onto your local machine, you can easily go and change Branch by simply clicking on the Current Branch at the top of the GitHub client for Windows and by selecting the branch you wish to work on. The moment you change branch from the GitHub client, the file that are located in the directory where you cloned the Forked Repository's content will get updated with the content for that branch. When dealing with Git, you always work in the same clone repository. The fact that you have multiple branches existing in a clone repository doesn't mean that you will have multiple copies of the files on the machine. You control what version of the files will be in that local repository by changing the current Branch in the GitHub client for Windows. Making Changes Once you made sure the branch representing the feature or the issue you are about to work on is selected in the Current Branch of the GitHub client for Windows, you can go ahead and start making changes to the local files. I personally recommend editing the files in Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), but using other tools such as the PowerShell Integrated Script Editor (ISE) or even other Scripting Editor tool will work just as good. Committing Changes Committing changes in the context of Git means saving the changes in the currently selected branch, but locally . Git keeps some sort of a local database when a repository is cloned, and upon committing changes, these are saved back to the local database. So for example, if you are working on multiple changes in various branches at the same time, you want to make sure you commit your changes to the current branch before using the GitHub client for Windows to change branch. Otherwise your changes will get overwritten by the changes in the newly selected branch (remember that changing a branch updates the local files). To commit a change, once the changes are made to the files, open the GitHub Client for Windows. the client should be smart enough to automatically detect that changes have been made. Once changes are detected in the GitHub client for Windows, you will be allowed to give a Summary and a Description for the changes you are about to commit, and to commit them back to the local database by clicking on the Commit To button. Push Committed Changes Back to GitHub Now the changes have been committed back to the local database, we need to Push them up back into GitHub. To do so, we need to click on the Push Origin button at the top of the GitHub client for Windows. To validate that your recent changes have been successfully uploaded back into GitHub, navigate to the main page of your Forked Repository, and make sure you select the branch in which you just uploaded (PUSHED) you changes back into. You should see a mention at the top, in the history section, that lists your latest changes that have been successfully uploaded back into GitHub. Merging the Changes back into Your Dev Branch As explained in step 2 above, the operation of merging two branches together in Git is called a Pull Request. In our case we discussed that once you are done making changes in your branch, inside your Forked Repository, that 2 Pull Requests have to happen before your changes make it back into the Main Repository. The first Pull Request will merge the changes in your Feature/Issue specific branch, back into your Forked Repository's Dev branch. To initiate a Pull Request, click on the Branch menu inside the GitHub client for Windows, and select the Create pull request option. This will launch the GitHub Pull request form in the browser. Make sure you update the left drop down menu (base:) to point to your Forked Repository's Dev Branch. Make sure that the right hand drop down menu (compare:) has your feature/issue specific branch selected. Now that both the base and compare branches have been properly selected, you can initiate the Pull Request by clicking on the Create pull request button. If all goes well and no conflicts were detected, GitHub will offer you the option to Merge pull request . Click on that green button to initiate the merge operation. This will prompt you to confirm your intentions. Click on the Confirm merge green button. At this point, your changes have been successfully merged back into the Dev branch of your Forked Repository, and chances are you no longer need that Feature/Issue specific branch. You can simply delete it by clicking the purple Delete branch button that GitHub presents to you. We are almost there, we now need to create yet another Pull Request, this time to merge the changes we just merged into our Forked Repository's Dev branch back into the Main Repository's Dev branch. From the GitHub client, select once again the Branch > Create pull request option. This time around, in the Pull Request online form, make sure the left branch (base fork:) is pointing to the Main Repository's Dev branch, and that the right one (head fork:) is set to your Forked Repository's Dev branch. Click on the green Create pull request button. Provide a Summary and a Description for your Pull Request, and click on the green Create pull request button yet again. At that point, you are done! The Core team will review your changes, provide feedback if required, and will merge the changes back into the official Main Repository.

It allows you to write a definition for how your Microsoft 365 tenant should be configured, automate the deployment of that configuration and ensures the monitoring of the defined configuration, notifying and acting on detected configuration drifts. It also allows you to extract a full-fidelity configuration out of any existing Microsoft 365 tenant. The tool covers all major Microsoft 365 workloads such as Exchange Online, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, Security and Compliance, Power Platforms, Intune and Planner. Microsoft365DSC is build as a module for the PowerShell Desired State Configuration framework and is made available via the PowerShell Gallery . Automate \u00b6 Using PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) syntax, write a complete definition of how you want your Microsoft 365 tenant to be configured. The Microsoft365DSC module allows Microsoft 365 administrators to define how the configuration of the various workloads (SharePoint, Exchange, Security & Compliance, Teams, etc.), and apply the configuration in an automated way. For example, administrator that wishes to deploy a new Search Managed Property to their SharePoint Online workload, can do so with similar lines of code (all code examples ca be found on the Resources List wiki page): SPOSearchManagedProperty SearchMP { Searchable = $True FullTextIndex = \"\" MappedCrawledProperties = @() GlobalAdminAccount = $credsGlobalAdmin LanguageNeutralTokenization = $True CompanyNameExtraction = $False AllowMultipleValues = $True Aliases = $True Queryable = $True Name = \"TestManagedProperty\" Safe = $True Description = \"Description of item\" FinerQueryTokenization = $True Retrievable = $True Type = \"Text\" CompleteMatching = $True FullTextContext = 4 Sortable = \"Yes\" Refinable = \"Yes\" Ensure = \"Present\" TokenNormalization = $True } Just like any other normal PowerShell DSC configuration, your Microsoft365DSC file will need to be compiled into a .MOF file for the Local Configuration Manager to be able to apply it. Once your configuration file has been compiled, you can execute the configuration process by calling into the Start-DSCConfiguration PowerShell cmdlet. All configuration resources defined by Microsoft365DSC will make remote calls back to the Microsoft 365 tenant using various underlying frameworks and components (Microsoft Teams PowerShell Module, SharePoint PnP, Azure Active Directory, etc.). It is therefore important that the machine that executes the configuration has internet connectivity back to the Microsoft 365 tenant you are trying to configure. For additional information on how to get started with PowerShell Desired State Configuration, you can refer to the Introduction to PowerShell Desired State Configuraton training video. See the Automating page for more information about possible options. Export \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC is the very first PowerShell project that natively supports ReverseDSC. This means that by simply installing the module, you are able to leverage ReverseDSC to extract the entire configuration of any existing tenants. The module exposes a cmdlet called Export-M365DSCConfiguration which launches a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows you to pick and choose what configuration components you wish to extract in a granular fashion. Upon providing credentials with correct permissions, the tool will begin the extraction of the configuration. Once it completes the extraction, it will prompt you to specify a destination directory to store the extracted artifacts. The tool will extract several artifacts, including all SharePoint Add-ins and Frameworks packages, the configuration itself, and a metadata file that contains all variables that are specific to your environment. That metadata file (.psd1) abstracts components of you configuration, such as the tenant name, in order to make it as easy as possible for you to replicate those configurations across tenants. As an example, you can extract the configuration from any given tenant using the ReverseDSC functionality, open the extracted .psd1 metadata file, change the tenant's name to a new destination, and apply that new configuration. This allows organizations to keep the configuration of multiple tenants in synchronization with one another. See the Exporting page for more information about possible options. Synchronize \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC makes it very easy for users to keep multiple tenants' configuration synchronized. With the tool you can export the configuration from any existing tenant and re-apply it onto multiple other tenants, keeping their configuration synchronized. You can use this to grab the configuration of a production tenant and apply this configuration onto a test tenant, making sure you can troubleshoot issues with the exact production configuration. Assess \u00b6 Assess any Microsoft 365 tenant against a known good configuration and generate a discrepency report. Microsoft365DSC makes it feasible for organizations to validate the configuration of their existing Microsoft 365 tenant against industry's best practices with a single line command. You can assess any tenant against any baseline configuration that you and your team developed or use official Blueprints. Microsoft365DSC also allows you to compare two configuration files and obtain the delta between the two. Whether you wish to compare the configuration between 2 tenants or two point-in-time exports of the same tenant, we've got you covered! See the Assessing page for more information about possible options. Monitor \u00b6 Automatic monitoring of configuration drifts in your tenant and notification about detected drifts with in-depth details for troubleshooting. Microsoft365DSC will perform regular checks to detect configuration drifts (every 15 minutes by default) and can take one of the following 3 actions when drifts are detected: Fix the drift automatically by re-applying the desired configuration; Log detailed information about the drifts detected in Event Viewer; Notify administrators via emails when drifts are detected, providing them with a detailed report as to what the drifts are (requires the use of Azure DevOPS pipelines); See the Monitoring page for more information about possible options. Report \u00b6 Take any Microsoft365DSC configuration and generate a user friendly report from it in an Excel or HTML format. With a single command you can convert any Microsoft365DSC configuration See the Reporting page for more information about possible options.","title":"What is Microsoft365DSC?"},{"location":"resources/overview/","text":"Resources Overview \u00b6 Microsoft 365 DSC has a lot of resources available, make sure to navigate on the left side of this page to see which resources there are.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"resources/azure-ad/AADApplication/","text":"AADApplication \u00b6 Parameters \u00b6 Parameter Attribute DataType Description Allowed Values Name Write String Name of the requested permission.

IntuneDeviceCompliancePolicyAndroidWorkProfile \u00b6 Description \u00b6 This resource configures the settings of Android Work Profile device compliance policies in your cloud-based organization. Permissions Needed \u00b6 To authenticate via Azure Active Directory, this resource requires the following Delegated permissions: Automate DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All (Delegated) Export DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All (Delegated) NOTE: All permisions listed above require admin consent. Parameters \u00b6 Microsoft Defender for Endpoint - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score Select the maximum allowed machine risk score for devices evaluated by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Devices which exceed this score get marked as noncompliant. Not configured ( default ) Clear Low Medium High Device Health - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Rooted devices Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Block - Mark rooted (jailbroken) devices as not compliant. Require the device to be at or under the Device Threat Level Select the maximum allowed device threat level evaluated by your mobile threat defense service. Devices that exceed this threat level are marked noncompliant. To use this setting, choose the allowed threat level: Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Secured - This option is the most secure, and means that the device can't have any threats. If the device is detected with any level of threats, it's evaluated as noncompliant. Low - The device is evaluated as compliant if only low-level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a noncompliant status. Medium - The device is evaluated as compliant if the threats that are present on the device are low or medium level. If the device is detected to have high-level threats, it's determined to be noncompliant. High - This option is the least secure, as it allows all threat levels. It may be useful if you're using this solution only for reporting purposes. Google Play Protect - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Google Play Services is configured Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Require that the Google Play services app is installed and enabled. Google Play services allows security updates, and is a base-level dependency for many security features on certified-Google devices. Up-to-date security provider Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Require that an up-to-date security provider can protect a device from known vulnerabilities. SafetyNet device attestation Enter the level of SafetyNet attestation that must be met. Your options: Not configured ( default ) - Setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Check basic integrity Check basic integrity & certified devices Note: * On Android Enterprise devices, Threat scan on apps is a device configuration policy. Using a configuration policy, administrators can enable the setting on a device. See Android Enterprise device restriction settings. Device Properties - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Operating System Version - for Personally-Owned Work Profile Minimum OS version When a device doesn't meet the minimum OS version requirement, it's reported as non-compliant. A link with information on how to upgrade is shown. The end user can upgrade their device, and then access organization resources. By default, no version is configured. Maximum OS version When a device is using an OS version later than the version in the rule, access to organization resources is blocked. The user is asked to contact their IT administrator. Until a rule is changed to allow the OS version, this device can't access organization resources. By default, no version is configured. System security - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Require a password to unlock mobile devices Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Users must enter a password before they can access their device. This setting applies at the device level. If you only need to require a password at the Personally-Owned Work Profile level, then use a configuration policy. See Android Enterprise device configuration settings. Required password type Choose if a password should include only numeric characters, or a mix of numerals and other characters. Your options: Device Default Low security biometric At least numeric ( default ): Enter the minimum password length a user must enter, between 4 and 16 characters. Numeric complex: Enter the minimum password length a user must enter, between 4 and 16 characters. At least alphabetic: Enter the minimum password length a user must enter, between 4 and 16 characters. At least alphanumeric: Enter the minimum password length a user must enter, between 4 and 16 characters. At least alphanumeric with symbols: Enter the minimum password length a user must enter, between 4 and 16 characters. Depending on the password type you select, the following settings are available: * Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required Enter the idle time before the user must reenter their password. Options include the default of Not configured, and from 1 Minute to 8 hours. * Number of days until password expires Enter the number of days, between 1-365, until the device password must be changed. For example, to change the password after 60 days, enter 60. When the password expires, users are prompted to create a new password. * Minimum password length Enter the minimum length the password must have, between 4 and 16 characters. * Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse Enter the number of recent passwords that can't be reused. Use this setting to restrict the user from creating previously used passwords. Encryption - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Encryption of data storage on device Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Encrypt data storage on your devices. You don't have to configure this setting because Android Enterprise devices enforce encryption. Device Security - for Personally-Owned Work Profile \u00b6 Block apps from unknown sources Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Block - Block devices with Security > Unknown Sources enabled sources (supported on Android 4.0 through Android 7.x. Not supported by Android 8.0 and later). To side-load apps, unknown sources must be allowed. If you're not side-loading Android apps, then set this feature to Block to enable this compliance policy. Company portal app runtime integrity Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Choose Require to confirm the Company Portal app meets all the following requirements: Has the default runtime environment installed Is properly signed Isn't in debug-mode Is installed from a known source Block USB debugging on device Not configured ( default ) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Block - Prevent devices from using the USB debugging feature. You don't have to configure this setting because USB debugging is already disabled on Android Enterprise devices. Minimum security patch level Select the oldest security patch level a device can have. Devices that aren't at least at this patch level are noncompliant. The date must be entered in the YYYY-MM-DD format. By default, no date is configured.

IntuneDeviceCompliancePolicyWindows10 \u00b6 Description \u00b6 This resource configures the settings of Windows 10 compliance policies in your cloud-based organization. Permissions Needed \u00b6 To authenticate via Azure Active Directory, this resource requires the following Delegated permissions: Automate DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All (Delegated) Export DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All (Delegated) NOTE: All permisions listed above require admin consent. Parameters \u00b6 Device Health \u00b6 Windows Health Attestation Service evaluation rules \u00b6 Require BitLocker: Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption encrypts all data stored on the Windows operating system volume. BitLocker uses the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to help protect the Windows operating system and user data. It also helps confirm that a computer isn't tampered with, even if its left unattended, lost, or stolen. If the computer is equipped with a compatible TPM, BitLocker uses the TPM to lock the encryption keys that protect the data. As a result, the keys can't be accessed until the TPM verifies the state of the computer. Not configured (default) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - The device can protect data that's stored on the drive from unauthorized access when the system is off, or hibernates. Device HealthAttestation CSP - BitLockerStatus Require Secure Boot to be enabled on the device: Not configured (default) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - The system is forced to boot to a factory trusted state. The core components that are used to boot the machine must have correct cryptographic signatures that are trusted by the organization that manufactured the device. The UEFI firmware verifies the signature before it lets the machine start. If any files are tampered with, which breaks their signature, the system doesn't boot. Device Properties \u00b6 Operating System Version \u00b6 To discover build versions for all Windows 10 Feature Updates and Cumulative Updates (to be used in some of the fields below), see Windows 10 release information. Be sure to include the 10.0. prefix before the build numbers, as the following examples illustrate. Minimum OS version: Enter the minimum allowed version in the major.minor.build.revision number format. To get the correct value, open a command prompt, and type ver. The ver command returns the version in the following format: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1] When a device has an earlier version than the OS version you enter, it's reported as noncompliant. A link with information on how to upgrade is shown. The end user can choose to upgrade their device. After they upgrade, they can access company resources. Maximum OS version: Enter the maximum allowed version, in the major.minor.build.revision number format. To get the correct value, open a command prompt, and type ver. The ver command returns the version in the following format: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1] When a device is using an OS version later than the version entered, access to organization resources is blocked. The end user is asked to contact their IT administrator. The device can't access organization resources until the rule is changed to allow the OS version. Minimum OS required for mobile devices: Enter the minimum allowed version, in the major.minor.build number format. When a device has an earlier version that the OS version you enter, it's reported as noncompliant. A link with information on how to upgrade is shown. The end user can choose to upgrade their device. After they upgrade, they can access company resources. Maximum OS required for mobile devices: Enter the maximum allowed version, in the major.minor.build number. When a device is using an OS version later than the version entered, access to organization resources is blocked. The end user is asked to contact their IT administrator. The device can't access organization resources until the rule is changed to allow the OS version. Valid operating system builds: Specify a list of minimum and maximum operating system builds. Valid operating system builds provides additional flexibility when compared against minimum and maximum OS versions. Consider a scenario where minimum OS version is set to 10.0.18362.xxx (Windows 10 1903) and maximum OS version is set to 10.0.18363.xxx (Windows 10 1909). This configuration can allow a Windows 10 1903 device that doesn't have recent cumulative updates installed to be identified as compliant. Minimum and maximum OS versions might be suitable if you have standardized on a single Windows 10 release, but might not address your requirements if you need to use multiple builds, each with specific patch levels. In such a case, consider leveraging valid operating system builds instead, which allows multiple builds to be specified as per the following example. Example: The following table is an example of a range for the acceptable operating systems versions for different Windows 10 releases. In this example, three different Feature Updates have been allowed (1809, 1909 and 2004). Specifically, only those versions of Windows and which have applied cumulative updates from June to September 2020 will be considered to be compliant. This is sample data only. The table includes a first column that includes any text you want to describe the entry, followed by the minimum and maximum OS version for that entry. The second and third columns must adhere to valid OS build versions in the major.minor.build.revision number format. After you define one or more entries, you can Export the list as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Description Minimum OS version Maximum OS version Win 10 2004 (Jun-Sept 2020) 10.0.19041.329 10.0.19041.508 Win 10 1909 (Jun-Sept 2020) 10.0.18363.900 10.0.18363.1110 Win 10 1809 (Jun-Sept 2020) 10.0.17763.1282 10.0.17763.1490 Configuration Manager Compliance \u00b6 Applies only to co-managed devices running Windows 10 and later. Intune-only devices return a not available status. Require device compliance from Configuration Manager: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check for any of the Configuration Manager settings for compliance. Require - Require all settings (configuration items) in Configuration Manager to be compliant. System Security \u00b6 Password \u00b6 Require a password to unlock mobile devices: Not configured (default) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Users must enter a password before they can access their device. Simple passwords: Not configured (default) - Users can create simple passwords, such as 1234 or 1111. Block - Users can't create simple passwords, such as 1234 or 1111. Password type: Choose the type of password or PIN required. Your options: Device (default) - Require a password, numeric PIN, or alphanumeric PIN Numeric - Require a password or numeric PIN Alphanumeric - Require a password, or alphanumeric PIN. When set to Alphanumeric, the following settings are available: Password complexity: Your options: Require digits and lowercase letters (default) Require digits, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters Require digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters Minimum password length: Enter the minimum number of digits or characters that the password must have. Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required: Enter the idle time before the user must reenter their password. Password expiration (days): Enter the number of days before the password expires, and they must create a new one, from 1-730. Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse: Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used. Require password when device returns from idle state (Mobile and Holographic): Not configured (default) Require - Require device users to enter the password every time the device returns from an idle state. Important When the password requirement is changed on a Windows desktop, users are impacted the next time they sign in, as that's when the device goes from idle to active. Users with passwords that meet the requirement are still prompted to change their passwords. Encryption \u00b6 Encryption of data storage on a device: This setting applies to all drives on a device. Not configured (default) Require - Use Require to encrypt data storage on your devices. Note The Encryption of data storage on a device setting generically checks for the presence of encryption on the device, more specifically at the OS drive level. Currently, Intune supports only the encryption check with BitLocker. For a more robust encryption setting, consider using Require BitLocker, which leverages Windows Device Health Attestation to validate Bitlocker status at the TPM level. Device Security \u00b6 Firewall: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't control the Microsoft Defender Firewall, nor change existing settings. Require - Turn on the Microsoft Defender Firewall, and prevent users from turning it off. Note If the device immediately syncs after a reboot, or immediately syncs waking from sleep, then this setting may report as an Error. This scenario might not affect the overall device compliance status. To re-evaluate the compliance status, manually sync the device. Trusted Platform Module (TPM): Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check the device for a TPM chip version. Require - Intune checks the TPM chip version for compliance. The device is compliant if the TPM chip version is greater than 0 (zero). The device isn't compliant if there isn't a TPM version on the device. Antivirus: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check for any antivirus solutions installed on the device. Require - Check compliance using antivirus solutions that are registered with Windows Security Center, such as Symantec and Microsoft Defender. Antispyware: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check for any antispyware solutions installed on the device. Require - Check compliance using antispyware solutions that are registered with Windows Security Center, such as Symantec and Microsoft Defender. Defender \u00b6 The following compliance settings are supported with Windows 10 Desktop. Microsoft Defender Antimalware: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't control the service, nor change existing settings. Require - Turn on the Microsoft Defender anti-malware service, and prevent users from turning it off. Microsoft Defender Antimalware minimum version: Enter the minimum allowed version of Microsoft Defender anti-malware service. For example, enter 4.11.0.0. When left blank, any version of the Microsoft Defender anti-malware service can be used. By (default) , no version is configured. Microsoft Defender Antimalware security intelligence up-to-date: Controls the Windows Security virus and threat protection updates on the devices. Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't enforce any requirements. Require - Force the Microsoft Defender security intelligence be up-to-date. Real-time protection: Not configured ( (default) ) - Intune doesn't control this feature, nor change existing settings. Require - Turn on real-time protection, which scans for malware, spyware, and other unwanted software. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint \u00b6 Microsoft Defender for Endpoint rules \u00b6 For additional information on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration in conditional access scenarios, see Configure Conditional Access in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score: Use this setting to take the risk assessment from your defense threat services as a condition for compliance. Choose the maximum allowed threat level: Not configured ( (default) ) Clear -This option is the most secure, as the device can't have any threats. If the device is detected as having any level of threats, it's evaluated as non-compliant. Low - The device is evaluated as compliant if only low-level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a non-compliant status. Medium - The device is evaluated as compliant if existing threats on the device are low or medium level. If the device is detected to have high-level threats, it's determined to be non-compliant. High - This option is the least secure, and allows all threat levels. It may be useful if you're using this solution only for reporting purposes. Windows Holographic for Business \u00b6 Windows Holographic for Business uses the Windows 10 and later platform. Windows Holographic for Business supports the following setting: System Security > Encryption > Encryption of data storage on device. To verify device encryption on the Microsoft HoloLens, see Verify device encryption. Surface Hub \u00b6 Surface Hub uses the Windows 10 and later platform. Surface Hubs are supported for both compliance and Conditional Access. To enable these features on Surface Hubs, we recommend you enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment in Intune (requires Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)), and target the Surface Hub devices as device groups. Surface Hubs are required to be Azure AD joined for compliance and Conditional Access to work. For guidance, see set up enrollment for Windows devices. Special consideration for Surface Hubs running Windows 10 Team OS: Surface Hubs that run Windows 10 Team OS do not support the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Password compliance policies at this time. Therefore, for Surface Hubs that run Windows 10 Team OS set the following two settings to their (default) of Not configured : * In the category Password, set Require a password to unlock mobile devices to the (default) of Not configured. * In the category Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, set Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score to the (default) of Not configured.

IntuneDeviceConfigurationPolicyAndroidDeviceOwner \u00b6 Description \u00b6 This resource configures the settings of Windows 10 compliance policies in your cloud-based organization. Permissions Needed \u00b6 To authenticate via Azure Active Directory, this resource requires the following Delegated permissions: Automate DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All (Delegated) Export DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All (Delegated) NOTE: All permisions listed above require admin consent. Parameters \u00b6 Device Health \u00b6 Windows Health Attestation Service evaluation rules \u00b6 Require BitLocker: Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption encrypts all data stored on the Windows operating system volume. BitLocker uses the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) to help protect the Windows operating system and user data. It also helps confirm that a computer isn't tampered with, even if its left unattended, lost, or stolen. If the computer is equipped with a compatible TPM, BitLocker uses the TPM to lock the encryption keys that protect the data. As a result, the keys can't be accessed until the TPM verifies the state of the computer. Not configured (default) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - The device can protect data that's stored on the drive from unauthorized access when the system is off, or hibernates. Device HealthAttestation CSP - BitLockerStatus Require Secure Boot to be enabled on the device: Not configured (default) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - The system is forced to boot to a factory trusted state. The core components that are used to boot the machine must have correct cryptographic signatures that are trusted by the organization that manufactured the device. The UEFI firmware verifies the signature before it lets the machine start. If any files are tampered with, which breaks their signature, the system doesn't boot. Device Properties \u00b6 Operating System Version \u00b6 To discover build versions for all Windows 10 Feature Updates and Cumulative Updates (to be used in some of the fields below), see Windows 10 release information. Be sure to include the 10.0. prefix before the build numbers, as the following examples illustrate. Minimum OS version: Enter the minimum allowed version in the major.minor.build.revision number format. To get the correct value, open a command prompt, and type ver. The ver command returns the version in the following format: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1] When a device has an earlier version than the OS version you enter, it's reported as noncompliant. A link with information on how to upgrade is shown. The end user can choose to upgrade their device. After they upgrade, they can access company resources. Maximum OS version: Enter the maximum allowed version, in the major.minor.build.revision number format. To get the correct value, open a command prompt, and type ver. The ver command returns the version in the following format: Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.17134.1] When a device is using an OS version later than the version entered, access to organization resources is blocked. The end user is asked to contact their IT administrator. The device can't access organization resources until the rule is changed to allow the OS version. Minimum OS required for mobile devices: Enter the minimum allowed version, in the major.minor.build number format. When a device has an earlier version that the OS version you enter, it's reported as noncompliant. A link with information on how to upgrade is shown. The end user can choose to upgrade their device. After they upgrade, they can access company resources. Maximum OS required for mobile devices: Enter the maximum allowed version, in the major.minor.build number. When a device is using an OS version later than the version entered, access to organization resources is blocked. The end user is asked to contact their IT administrator. The device can't access organization resources until the rule is changed to allow the OS version. Valid operating system builds: Specify a list of minimum and maximum operating system builds. Valid operating system builds provides additional flexibility when compared against minimum and maximum OS versions. Consider a scenario where minimum OS version is set to 10.0.18362.xxx (Windows 10 1903) and maximum OS version is set to 10.0.18363.xxx (Windows 10 1909). This configuration can allow a Windows 10 1903 device that doesn't have recent cumulative updates installed to be identified as compliant. Minimum and maximum OS versions might be suitable if you have standardized on a single Windows 10 release, but might not address your requirements if you need to use multiple builds, each with specific patch levels. In such a case, consider leveraging valid operating system builds instead, which allows multiple builds to be specified as per the following example. Example: The following table is an example of a range for the acceptable operating systems versions for different Windows 10 releases. In this example, three different Feature Updates have been allowed (1809, 1909 and 2004). Specifically, only those versions of Windows and which have applied cumulative updates from June to September 2020 will be considered to be compliant. This is sample data only. The table includes a first column that includes any text you want to describe the entry, followed by the minimum and maximum OS version for that entry. The second and third columns must adhere to valid OS build versions in the major.minor.build.revision number format. After you define one or more entries, you can Export the list as a comma-separated values (CSV) file. Description Minimum OS version Maximum OS version Win 10 2004 (Jun-Sept 2020) 10.0.19041.329 10.0.19041.508 Win 10 1909 (Jun-Sept 2020) 10.0.18363.900 10.0.18363.1110 Win 10 1809 (Jun-Sept 2020) 10.0.17763.1282 10.0.17763.1490 Configuration Manager Compliance \u00b6 Applies only to co-managed devices running Windows 10 and later. Intune-only devices return a not available status. Require device compliance from Configuration Manager: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check for any of the Configuration Manager settings for compliance. Require - Require all settings (configuration items) in Configuration Manager to be compliant. System Security \u00b6 Password \u00b6 Require a password to unlock mobile devices: Not configured (default) - This setting isn't evaluated for compliance or non-compliance. Require - Users must enter a password before they can access their device. Simple passwords: Not configured (default) - Users can create simple passwords, such as 1234 or 1111.

Your options: Device (default) - Require a password, numeric PIN, or alphanumeric PIN Numeric - Require a password or numeric PIN Alphanumeric - Require a password, or alphanumeric PIN. When set to Alphanumeric, the following settings are available: Password complexity: Your options: Require digits and lowercase letters (default) Require digits, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters Require digits, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters Minimum password length: Enter the minimum number of digits or characters that the password must have. Maximum minutes of inactivity before password is required: Enter the idle time before the user must reenter their password. Password expiration (days): Enter the number of days before the password expires, and they must create a new one, from 1-730. Number of previous passwords to prevent reuse: Enter the number of previously used passwords that can't be used. Require password when device returns from idle state (Mobile and Holographic): Not configured (default) Require - Require device users to enter the password every time the device returns from an idle state. Important When the password requirement is changed on a Windows desktop, users are impacted the next time they sign in, as that's when the device goes from idle to active. Users with passwords that meet the requirement are still prompted to change their passwords. Encryption \u00b6 Encryption of data storage on a device: This setting applies to all drives on a device. Not configured (default) Require - Use Require to encrypt data storage on your devices. Note The Encryption of data storage on a device setting generically checks for the presence of encryption on the device, more specifically at the OS drive level. Currently, Intune supports only the encryption check with BitLocker. For a more robust encryption setting, consider using Require BitLocker, which leverages Windows Device Health Attestation to validate Bitlocker status at the TPM level. Device Security \u00b6 Firewall: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't control the Microsoft Defender Firewall, nor change existing settings. Require - Turn on the Microsoft Defender Firewall, and prevent users from turning it off. Note If the device immediately syncs after a reboot, or immediately syncs waking from sleep, then this setting may report as an Error. This scenario might not affect the overall device compliance status. To re-evaluate the compliance status, manually sync the device. Trusted Platform Module (TPM): Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check the device for a TPM chip version. Require - Intune checks the TPM chip version for compliance. The device is compliant if the TPM chip version is greater than 0 (zero). The device isn't compliant if there isn't a TPM version on the device. Antivirus: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check for any antivirus solutions installed on the device. Require - Check compliance using antivirus solutions that are registered with Windows Security Center, such as Symantec and Microsoft Defender. Antispyware: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't check for any antispyware solutions installed on the device.

Defender \u00b6 The following compliance settings are supported with Windows 10 Desktop. Microsoft Defender Antimalware: Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't control the service, nor change existing settings. Require - Turn on the Microsoft Defender anti-malware service, and prevent users from turning it off. Microsoft Defender Antimalware minimum version: Enter the minimum allowed version of Microsoft Defender anti-malware service. For example, enter 4.11.0.0. When left blank, any version of the Microsoft Defender anti-malware service can be used. By (default) , no version is configured. Microsoft Defender Antimalware security intelligence up-to-date: Controls the Windows Security virus and threat protection updates on the devices. Not configured (default) - Intune doesn't enforce any requirements. Require - Force the Microsoft Defender security intelligence be up-to-date. Real-time protection: Not configured ( (default) ) - Intune doesn't control this feature, nor change existing settings. Require - Turn on real-time protection, which scans for malware, spyware, and other unwanted software. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint \u00b6 Microsoft Defender for Endpoint rules \u00b6 For additional information on Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration in conditional access scenarios, see Configure Conditional Access in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score: Use this setting to take the risk assessment from your defense threat services as a condition for compliance. Choose the maximum allowed threat level: Not configured ( (default) ) Clear -This option is the most secure, as the device can't have any threats. If the device is detected as having any level of threats, it's evaluated as non-compliant. Low - The device is evaluated as compliant if only low-level threats are present. Anything higher puts the device in a non-compliant status. Medium - The device is evaluated as compliant if existing threats on the device are low or medium level. If the device is detected to have high-level threats, it's determined to be non-compliant. High - This option is the least secure, and allows all threat levels. It may be useful if you're using this solution only for reporting purposes. Windows Holographic for Business \u00b6 Windows Holographic for Business uses the Windows 10 and later platform. Windows Holographic for Business supports the following setting: System Security > Encryption > Encryption of data storage on device. To verify device encryption on the Microsoft HoloLens, see Verify device encryption. Surface Hub \u00b6 Surface Hub uses the Windows 10 and later platform. Surface Hubs are supported for both compliance and Conditional Access. To enable these features on Surface Hubs, we recommend you enable Windows 10 automatic enrollment in Intune (requires Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)), and target the Surface Hub devices as device groups. Surface Hubs are required to be Azure AD joined for compliance and Conditional Access to work. For guidance, see set up enrollment for Windows devices. Special consideration for Surface Hubs running Windows 10 Team OS: Surface Hubs that run Windows 10 Team OS do not support the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Password compliance policies at this time. Therefore, for Surface Hubs that run Windows 10 Team OS set the following two settings to their (default) of Not configured : * In the category Password, set Require a password to unlock mobile devices to the (default) of Not configured. * In the category Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, set Require the device to be at or under the machine risk score to the (default) of Not configured.

The content of this managed property is included in the full-text index. For example, if the property is 'author', a simple query for 'Smith' returns items containing the word 'Smith' and items whose author property contains 'Smith'. FullTextIndex Write String Defines which full-text index the Managed Property is stored in. FullTextContext Write UInt32 Defines the context of a managed property within its full-text index. Queryable Write Boolean Enables querying against the specific Managed Property. The Managed Property field name must be included in the query, either specified in the query itself or included in the query programmatically. If the Managed Property is 'author', the query must contain 'author:Smith'. Retrievable Write Boolean Enables the content of this managed property to be returned in search results. Enable this setting for managed properties that are relevant to present in search results. AllowMultipleValues Write Boolean Allow multiple values of the same type in this managed property. For example, if this is the 'author' managed property, and a document has multiple authors, each author name will be stored as a separate value in this managed property. Refinable Write String Yes: Enables using the property as a refiner for search results in the front end. You must manually configure the refiner in the web part. Yes - latent: Enables switching refinable to active later, without having to do a full re-crawl when you switch. Both options require a full crawl to take effect. No, Yes - latent, Yes Sortable Write String Yes: Enables sorting the result set based on the property before the result set is returned. Use for example for large result sets that cannot be sorted and retrieved at the same time. Yes - latent: Enables switching sortable to active later, without having to do a full re-crawl when you switch. Both options require a full crawl to take effect. No, Yes - latent, Yes Safe Write Boolean Enables this managed property to be returned for queries executed by anonymous users. Enable this setting for managed properties that do not contain sensitive information and are appropriate for anonymous users to view. Aliases Write StringArray[] Define an alias for a managed property if you want to use the alias instead of the managed property name in queries and in search results. Use the original managed property and not the alias to map to a crawled property. Use an alias if you don't want to or don't have permission to create a new managed property. TokenNormalization Write Boolean Enable to return results independent of letter casing and diacritics(for example accented characters) used in the query. CompleteMatching Write Boolean By default, search returns partial matches between queries against this managed property and its content. Select Complete Matching for search to return exact matches instead. If a managed property 'Title' contains 'Contoso Sites', only the query Title: 'Contoso Sites' will give a result. LanguageNeutralTokenization Write Boolean By default, search depends on language when it breaks queries and content into parts (tokenization). Select language neutral tokenization if you have multilingual content and this managed property contains tags that are based on metadata term sets or other identifiers. FinerQueryTokenization Write Boolean By default, search tokenizes queries coarser than content. If a managed property 'ID' contains the string '1-23-456#7', and you query ID:'1-23', you might not get a partial match because search didn't break the query into small enough parts. Consider selecting finer query tokenization if the content of this managed property contains separators such as dots and dashes. Finer query tokenization makes queries against this managed property slower. MappedCrawledProperties Write StringArray[] Names of the crawled properties that are mapped to this managed property CompanyNameExtraction Write Boolean Enables the system to extract company name entities from the managed property when crawling new or updated items. Afterwards, the extracted entities can be used to set up refiners in the web part. Ensure Write String Present ensures the Search Managed Property exists.

It can be hosted locally or on the web and is used to assess the current configuration of any Microsoft 365 tenant against it to generate a discrepancy report. Other than having a different file extension than a normal DSC configuration, a Microsoft365DSC Blueprint can also include metadata that will be included as contextual information within the discrepancy report for configuration settings that have been identified as being different on a given tenant. The following is an example of a blueprint snippet which contains metadata: TeamsCallingPolicy M365DSCPolicy { AllowCallForwardingToPhone = $True ; ### L2|We <strong>recommend</strong> allowing call forwarding to phone lines because... AllowCallForwardingToUser = $True ; ### L3|Information about <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/MicrosoftTeams/teams-calling-policy\">call forwarding</a> AllowPrivateCalling = $false ; ### L1|<img src='warning.png' />We don't recommend allowing people to allow private calls due to....

Metadata in the blueprint needs to be included after the end of a line, following the configuration setting it related to. It is represented by the ### syntax. What follows the 3 pounds sign is an indicator of the level of severity related to the configuration setting assuming a drift was detected for it. The engine currently offers 3 levels of severity: L1- Critical, will appear in red in the discrepancy report. This indicates that this drift needs to be addressed as soon as possible. L2 - Warning, will appear in yellow in the discrepancy report. This indicates that a drift was detected for the given property and that we strongly recommend addressing it. L3 - Information, will appear in white in the discrepancy report. This indicates that a drift was detected and that it is up to the organization to decide if they want to address it or not. It is important to understand that if a drifted property doesn't have associated metadata in the blueprint, it will still appear in the discrepancy report. It simply won't have any contextual information associated with it.

Microsoft365DSC is an open-source solution that\u2019s available for free on GitHub . It is led by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community. Official documentation for the solution is available on the official site at https://Microsoft365DSC.com . Microsoft365DSC is the declarative form of Microsoft 365 tenant\u2019s configuration. It is to the Microsoft 365 environment what Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM) are to Azure. It allows you to represent your tenant\u2019s configuration-as-code using PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) , use it to automatically configure your Microsoft tenants in the described state, take snapshots of existing tenants into DSC declarative code, generate reports out of those snapshots, continuously monitor all your Microsoft 365 tenants for configuration drifts and be alerted when drifts are detected, clone the configuration of an existing tenant onto another and compare the configuration between one or multiple tenants. Prerequisites \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC is supported for PowerShell version 5.1 and 7.1. Support for newer versions of PowerShell is not yet offered since these have now decoupled the DSC engine into its own separate module and require additional work from the team. It is however on the roadmap as a priority item for the later part of Calendar Year of 2022. To get the best experience, it is recommended that you use the Windows Terminal to run and execute Microsoft365DSC. All screenshots provided in this article are using the Windows Terminal. This tool allows you to quickly switch between PowerShell versions and provide better support for icons and symbols that are used throughout Microsoft365DSC\u2019s experience. Microsoft Graph Permissions \u00b6 Most components of the Microsoft365DSC solution are using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK under the cover to authenticate and interact with Microsoft 365. By default, if you are using Microsoft365DSC without using your own Azure Active Directory application instance, the tool will automatically use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell application instance to authenticate. In order to be able to interact with these components, you need to grant your application or the Microsoft Graph PowerShell one the proper permissions against the Microsoft Graph scope. To determine what permission what permissions are required by a given component that uses Microsoft Graph, you can use the Get-M365DSCCompiledPermissionList cmdlet and pass in the list of parameters for which you wish to grant permissions for. Doing so will return an object with two properties. The ReadPermissions property contains a list of the minimal permissions that need to be granted for the app to be able to read information about the selected components. These are the permissions you want to grant if you are taking a snapshot of the configuration of an existing tenant. The second property, UpdatePermissions, contains the minimal permissions required to interact with and configure the selected components. You will need to grant your application these permissions if you are trying to apply a configuration onto a tenant. If you are trying to interact with all available components in Microsoft365DSC, you can get a complete picture of all permissions required across all resources by running the following line of PowerShell. Get-M365DSCCompiledPermissionList -ResourceNameList (Get-M365DSCAllResources) The Get-M365DSCAllResources cmdlet will return a list of all components available inside of the Microsoft365DSC solution which will then by passed in the Get-M365DSCCompiledPermissionList cmdlet which will compile the resulting permissions needed for the list of components it receives, in occurrence all of them. These permissions need to be granted to your application instance, either using the Azure portal or automating the process via PowerShell. We provide an easy way of consenting permissions to the Microsoft Graph PowerShell application in your tenant with the Update-M365DSCAllowedGraphScopes cmdlet. This cmdlet accepts either a list of components to grant the permissions for or can grant it for all resources if the -All switch is used. You also need to specify what type of permissions, Read or Update, you wish to grant it using the -Type parameter. Executing the cmdlet will prompt you to authenticate using an administrator account that has access to consent permissions to Azure AD applications in your environment. How to Install \u00b6 While the source code of the solution is open-sourced on GitHub at https://GitHub.com/Microsoft.Microsoft365DSC, the releases of the solutions are being published to the PowerShell Gallery . This means that the tool can be installed onto any machine by running the following command: Install-Module Microsoft365DSC -Force Executing this command can take a minute or two. Microsoft365DSC depends on several other modules to function properly. For example, it uses the MSCloudLoginAssistant module to delegate all authentication logic to the various workloads, it leverages a dozen Microsoft Graph PowerShell module to interact with various configuration settings, etc. Newer versions of Microsoft365DSC no longer download all the required prerequisites by default. When you install the Microsoft365DSC, you only get the core components. It is our recommendation that you run the following command to update all dependencies on the system after installing the module: Update-M365DSCDependencies Running the above command will automatically read the list of dependencies from the [root]/Dependencies/Manifest.psd1 file, check to see if they are installed on the machine with the proper version, and if not it will automatically download them and install them from the PowerShell Gallery. Depending on your configuration and on the version of PowerShell you are using, the installed modules may be put in different locations. The process of installing a PowerShell module from the PowerShell Gallery really just comes down to downloading the files from the gallery as a zip, extracting them and copying to a location on the system that is associated with PowerShell via environment variables. The following command will allow you to view the version of any given PowerShell module on a system along with its associated version: Get-Module Microsoft365DSC -ListAvailable | select ModuleBase, Version Authentication \u00b6 It is also very important for users to understand the authentication process of Microsoft365DSC. The solution supports connecting to the various workloads for either applying the configuration, monitoring it for configuration drifts or taking a snapshot of an existing configuration. It supports authenticating using either a set of credentials for a user, to use a Service Principal by specifying parameters such as an Azure Active Directory (AD) Application ID, or a combination of both. The recommendation is to use Service Principal whenever possible because it offers the most granular levels of security and doesn\u2019t introduce the risk of having to send high privileged credentials across the wire to authenticate. However, not all workloads supported by Microsoft365DSC are currently able to handle Service Principal authentication. Currently, the Security and Compliance and Microsoft Teams workload unfortunately do not support authenticating using the Service Principal of an Azure Active Directory Application. The following picture gives you an overview of what authentication mechanisms are supported by each workload and what underlying module is being used to authenticate for each. As you can see from the picture above, Credentials while being the least preferred option for security reasons, is the only option that works across all supported workloads. It is also important to clarify the difference between the Teams and the Skype for Business Online entries in the picture above. If we take a look a few months back, to manage Microsoft Teams using PowerShell you needed two different modules: one for the collaboration part of Microsoft Teams (the MicrosoftTeams PowerShell module) and one for the Skype For Business components (SkypeOnlineConnector). While the collaboration aspect of Teams, which includes Teams and Channels is accessible through Service Principal authentication, other components such as all Teams administrative policies are still only available through the Skype for Business part of the new combined MicrosoftTeams module and therefore don\u2019t work with service principal authentication. We are having discussions with the various product groups that are responsible for these PowerShell modules inside of Microsoft to have better consistency across all workloads on how to authenticate. Items highlighted in green in the table above, are workloads for which we use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK to authenticate against. Our plan is to update the underlying logic of every component inside of Microsoft365DSC to leverage that SDK as new APIs become available on Microsoft Graph. It is possible for a configuration to use a mix of credentials and Service Principals to authenticate against the various workloads. For example, if you decide to keep a master configuration for all of you tenant\u2019s configuration, you could have Azure AD components use the Service Principal of an app you\u2019ve created to authenticate, and further down in the configuration have your Security and Compliance components use credentials. That approach is perfectly fine, but we\u2019d recommend to try and split different workloads across different configuration files in this case to make it easier to manage. It is also important to note that we\u2019ve added logic inside of the command that allows you to take a snapshot of your current\u2019s tenant configuration to warn you when the components you are trying to capture can\u2019t be accessed based on the authentication model you\u2019ve selected. For example, if you are trying to take a snapshot of both Azure AD and Security and Compliance components, but are authenticating using a Service Principal, the tool will warn you that the Security and Compliance components can\u2019t be captured and that they will be ignored. In this case, the resulting capture would only contain the Azure AD components because those are the only ones the tool can get access to using Service Principal. Taking a Snapshot of Existing Tenant \u00b6 The first thing that most folks using the solution will want to do is take a snapshot of an existing tenant they have access to and that they are familiar with. As soon as you install the Microsoft365DSC module on a system, it will automatically get access to run the Export-M365DSCConfiguration PowerShell cmdlet which is the main command for initiating a snapshot of an existing configuration. In previous versions of the module, simply running the above cmdlet would automatically launch a Graphical User Interface that would allow you to pick and choose the components you wanted to capture the configuration for as part of your snapshot and initiate the capture process. Newer versions of the module have moved to an unattended process by default, meaning that running the cmdlet will expect additional parameters by default and will then attempt to initiate the snapshot process automatically without further human interaction. Initiating the snapshot process via the Export-M365DSCConfiguration cmdlet will begin by authenticating against all required workloads. The first thing it will do is compile a list of all components it is about to capture and figure out what workload they are part of. Then it will automatically authenticated against each one using the authentication parameters provided. Web Based User Interface \u00b6 While the default process has changed with recent versions of the module, you can still use a newly revamped, web-based User Interface to help you build the PowerShell command to execute based on the components you wish to capture. To launch this new web interface, simply use the -LaunchWebUI switch when calling the Export-M365DSCConfiguration cmdlet. This will automatically launch a new web browser interface and navigate you to https://Export.Microsoft365DSC.com From the interface, simply select the components you want, and click on the Generate button at the top right. This will open a new prompt that will allow you to copy the PowerShell command you need to run to capture a snapshot of the selected components via Microsoft365DSC. Simply copy this command and paste it in your PowerShell console to initiate the capture process. Unattended Capture \u00b6 As mentioned above, Microsoft365DSC now defaults to an unattended capture process when running the Export-M365DSCConfiguration cmdlet. To quickly get started, simply open a new PowerShell console and type in the cmdlet. By default, if you don\u2019t provide any additional parameters to the cmdlet, it will try to use credentials to authenticate against the various workloads. In the case where no additional authentication parameters are provided, Microsoft365DSC will prompt you for credentials and will use those credentials to authenticate throughout the capture process. You could always pass in the credentials in as a variable, which will bypass the credential prompt and automatically initiate the export process when calling the cmdlet. E.g. $creds = Get-Credential Export-M365DSCConfiguration -Credential $creds The same process applies if you are trying to authenticate using a Service Principal. In this case you would need to pass in the ApplicationID and TenantID parameter and decide whether to use an ApplicationSecret or a CertificateThumbprint. It is important to understand that the resulting file that contains the captured configuration will also implement the same authentication mechanism used by the capture process. For example, if you used credentials to capture the configuration, the resulting file will contain logic to capture credentials when it gets executed and every component it defines will also implement the Credential parameter. In comparison, if you used a Service Principal to do the export, the resulting file will implement logic to receive information about the Azure AD application instance to use and every component defined within the file will as well. As we can see from the image above, the Service Principal fields' values are coming from the Configuration Data file that also get stored along the configuration file during the snapshot process. If you take a look at the folder where the resulting files were stored, you should see a file named ConfigurationData.psd1. This is where the value for the parameters above are defined. It is also important to note, the resulting file will always contain random GUID for the name of the resources in the DSC configuration. These are random and are only used to ensure we don\u2019t have resource naming conflicts inside the configuration. They can be replaced by anything meaningful, as long as you don\u2019t have two components of the same resource type named the same across your configuration. Names are meaningless in the world of DSC and are only used as a primary key when compiling your configuration. Available Parameters \u00b6 The Microsoft365DSC tenant's configuration snapshot feature offers several options you can use to better control the output capture. This section provides an overview of each additional parameter that is available for the Export-M365DSCConfiguration cmdlet and how they can be used during the capture process LaunchWebUI \u00b6 As mentioned above, the moment this switch is present when calling the Export-M365DSCConfiguration cmdlet it will launch new browser window and navigate to the export user interface at https://export.microsoft365dsc.com. FileName \u00b6 This allows you to specify how you wish the resulting file to be named. Specify the name of the file, including the extension (e.g. .ps1). Omitting to specify this parameter will name the resulting file as M365TenantConfig.ps1 ConfigurationName \u00b6 This parameter allows you to specify how the DSC configuration object, inside of the exported configuration file will be named. Omitting to specify this parameter will result in the configuration object to be named as the file\u2019s name (e.g. M365TenantConfig). Path \u00b6 Specifies the location where the resulting file will be stored. Omitting to specify this parameter will prompt the user to provide the destination path at the end of the capture process. Components \u00b6 This parameter accepts an array containing the names of the components you want to capture as part of your snapshot. Omitting this parameter will default the capture process to capture all components that are part of the default components list (see parameter Mode). Workloads \u00b6 This component accepts an array containing the names of various workloads you wish to capture the components for as part of your snapshot process. Users need to specify the acronym of the workloads, which can be any of: * AAD \u2013 Azure Active Directory * EXO \u2013 Exchange Online * O365 \u2013 Office 365 administration * Intune \u2013 Intune * OD \u2013 OneDrive * Planner \u2013 Planner * PP \u2013 Power Platform * SC \u2013 Security and Compliance * SPO \u2013 SharePoint Online * Teams \u2013 Microsoft Teams By default, specifying a workload will only export components that are part of the default component list (see Mode). If you want to capture every component available for a given workload, you will need to combine this parameter with -Mode Full . Mode \u00b6 This parameter allows users to specify what set of components they wish to capture as part of their snapshot process. By default, Microsoft365DSC will exclude some components from the capture process either because these are likely to take a very long time to export (e.g. SPOPropertyBag) or that they are more related to data than actual configuration settings (e.g. Planner Tasks, SPOUserProfileProperty, etc.). Available modes are: * Lite * Default * Full And off course, omitting to specify this parameter will default to the default mode. To keep track of what resources are available in what mode, Microsoft365DSC defines two global variables which contain the list of resources unique to this extraction mode: $Global:DefaultComponents and $Global:FullComponents This means that the Lite extraction mode will contain all resources with the exception of those listed in Default and Full. The Default mode will include all resources from the Lite mode, plus the SPOApp and SPOSiteDesign components, and Full will include every resource available in the project. MaxProcesses \u00b6 There are a few components inside of Microsoft365DSC for which parallelism has been implemented as part of their snapshot process to improve speed. This parameter allows user to specify how many parallel threads should be created during the capture process. Components leveraging parallelism are: SPOPropertyBag, SPOUserProfileProperty and TeamsUser. The specified value for this parameter has to be between 1 and 100 . Instances of the components will be equally divided amongst the various threads. While there are advantages to implementing multithreading for the snapshot process, there are many disadvantages as well such as not being able to properly view ongoing progress inside threads and added complexity to the design of the resources. After weighting in the pros can cons of implementing this approach across all components to speed up the entire capture process, we\u2019ve opted to keep the design of the resources simpler (no use parallelism) for maintenance purposes and to ensure users have a consistent way of view progress during the snapshot process. GenerateInfo \u00b6 This parameter allows users to specify whether or not comments should be added as part of the exported file to provide additional information about the various types of components captured. Deploying Configurations \u00b6 This section explains how you can take a Microsoft365DSC configuration file you\u2019ve written (or captured using the snapshot feature) and apply the settings it defines onto a Microsoft 365 tenant. It is very important to understand that at this stage, we are using PowerShell Desired State (DSC) out-of-the-box and that the process of applying a DSC configuration is not something specific to Microsoft365DSC. Compiling and Validating the Configuration \u00b6 The first step in trying to deploy a DSC configuration is to compile the configuration file into what we call a Managed Object Format (MOF) file. To do so, simply execute the .ps1 file that contains your configuration. The process of compiling your configuration will also perform some level of validation on the configuration such as ensuring that every component defined in the file has all of their mandatory parameters defined and that there are no typos in components or property names. If the compilation process is successful, you should see a mention that the .mof file was created. This file gets created in the same location where your configuration file is located by default and will create a new folder based on the name of the configuration object defined within your file. Securing your Compiled Configuration \u00b6 In the case where you are using credentials to authenticate to your tenant, you will be prompted to provide credentials at compilation time for your configuration. By default, these credentials will be stored as plain text in the resulting MOF file, which is a big security concern. To remediate to this, PowerShell DSC lets us use an encryption certificate to encrypt information about credentials in the MOF files. To make this process easier for users, Microsoft365DSC defines a function named Set-M365DSCAgentCertificateConfiguration which will automatically generate an encryption certificate and configure the PowerShell DSC engine on the system to use it for encrypting the MOF files. The cmdlet will return the Thumbprint for the newly generated certificate. You can also have the cmdlet generate the private key for the certificate by using the -GeneratePFX switch and specifying a password with the -Password parameter. This will require you to also specify the -ForceRenew parameter so that a brand new certificate gets emitted. Once the certificate has been configured every time you do a snapshot of an existing tenant\u2019s configuration, a new M365DSC.cer certificate file will be stored in the same repository as the configuration files. The ConfigurationData.psd1 will also contain a new entry under the localhost node that will point to this certificate, effectively telling DSC to use this file to encrypt credentials when compiling. If you compile your configuration using the new certificate and take a look at your MOF file, you should see that the password for the credential object was successfully encrypted and is no longer showing in plaintext. Deploying the Configuration \u00b6 To initiate the deployment of a configuration onto a Microsoft 365 tenant, you need to use the out-of-the-box cmdlet provided by PowerShell DSC named Start-DSCConfiguration . By default, this cmdlet will execute as a background job. If you wish to monitor the execution of the process, you need to use the -Wait switch, which will make the process synchronous. We also recommend using the -Verbose switch with the command to get additional details on the progression of the process. The cmdlet takes in the path to the folder that contains the compiled .MOF file. e.g. Start-DSCConfiguration C:\\DemoM365DSC\\M365TenantConfig -Wait -Verbose -Force Executing the cmdlet will automatically authenticate against the affected workload using the authentication parameters provided at compilation time and will apply the configuration settings defined in the file. It is normal for this process to take several minutes if not hours to complete, based on how many components are defined in your configuration. It is important to understand that once the configuration completes its deployment, this will configure the PowerShell DSC engine on the current system to due frequent checks against your Microsoft 365 tenant to check for configuration drifts. By default, the engine will wake up every 15 minutes (minimum value possible). For more details on how to configure this, please refer to Configuring the Local Configuration Manager . If you simply want to apply the configuration on the tenant as a one off and prevent the system form doing frequent checks for configuration drifts, you can remove the configuration you\u2019ve applied from memory by running the following PowerShell commands: Stop-DSCConfiguration -Force Remove-DSCConfigurationDocument -Stage Current Monitoring for Configuration Drifts \u00b6 Once a configuration has been applied to a Microsoft 365 tenant using Microsoft365DSC, the local system will perform regular checks to analyze the configuration of the remote tenant against what its desired state should be and detect any configuration drifts. This feature comes from PowerShell DSC out-of-the-box and is not something specific to Microsoft365DSC. By default the DSC engine on the system where the configuration was applied from will check for configuration drifts every 15 minutes. If a drift in configuration is detected, it will log it in Event Viewer on the machine by default. Detected drifts will get logged under the M365DSC log journal in Event Viewer. Microsoft365DSC provide very detailed entries in event viewer that help you identify exactly in what component a drift was detected as well as what property was detected to have drifted. Just like for any DSC module, you can also configure the DSC engine to automatically attempt to automatically fix detected drift and bring the tenant back into its desired state. This is referred to as the DSC configuration mode. To learn more about how you can configure the DSC engine to automatically fix detected drift, please refer to Configuring the Local Configuration Manager . Cloning Tenant's Configuration \u00b6 This feature of Microsoft365DSC is not a true standalone feature; it is a combination of existing features to unlock a new scenario for users. Since Microsoft365DSC is able to take a snapshot of any Microsoft 365 tenant and because we can deploy a Microsoft365DSC configuration onto any tenant, we can easily clone the configuration of any tenant over another one (or another set of tenants). When you take a snapshot of an existing tenant, the extracted configuration file doesn\u2019t contain any information that is specific to the source tenant. It abstracts it all into variables, which make the configuration generic instead of unique for a particular tenant. It is then at compilation time that you provide information about the environment onto which this configuration will be applied to. For example, let's assume you are trying to clone the configuration of Tenant A onto Tenant B. You would start by capturing the existing configuration of tenant A using credentials or a Service Principal that exists and has rights on Tenant A. This will generate the configuration file containing all the configuration settings for Tenant A. Then at compilation time, when trying to compile the extracted configuration into a MOF file, you will need to provide credentials or a Service Principal that has access to Tenant B. Then all that is left to do is to deploy the configuration onto Tenant B to have all the configurations settings from tenant A applied onto it. Generating Reports from Configurations \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC makes it very easy to generate user friendly reports from any configuration, whether you wrote it yourself or generated it using the configuration snapshot feature. The solution allows you to generate both HTML and Excel reports from existing files. To generate and Excel reports however, you need to have Office installed on the machine that you are trying to generate the report from. To generate reports, simply use the New-M365DSCReportFromConfiguration and specify what type of report you want using the Type parameter (specify HTML or Excel). The cmdlet also requires you to specify the full path to the .ps1 configuration file you want to generate the report from using the -ConfigurationPath parameter and specify where you wish to store the generated report using the -OutputPath parameter. Trying to generate an Excel report from a configuration will automatically launch the Excel client as part of the process. Users will see data being loaded progressively into it and once the generation processes has finished, columns will automatically be resized to fit the content. The report will also automatically put the key mandatory parameter (e.g. primary key) of each resource in bold and do some styling of the output. report. Generating an HTML report will generate a different result. It will create the report file at the location specified by the OutputPath parameter, but it won\u2019t actually launch the report in a browser. The New-M365DSCReportFromConfiguration cmdlet, when used for HTML reports will also return the raw HTML content of the report as seen in the image below. Comparing Configurations \u00b6 The Microsoft365DSC solution has a built-in engine to compare configurations and generate a delta report in HTML that shows the discrepancies between the two. You can either use it to compare the configuration between 2 files or you can use it to compare a configuration against another tenant and see how it defers from that tenant\u2019s current configuration. Comparing 2 Configuration Files \u00b6 Using the New-M365DSCDeltaReport cmdlet, you can specify the two configuration files you wish to compare using the -Source and -Destination parameters. You then need to specify where you wish to store the resulting HTML report using the -OutputPath parameter. Consider the following example, where I've taken two configuration snapshots of my tenant over a period of 6 months apart. I wish to determine what configuration settings have changed over that period of time. Using the New-M365DSCDeltaReport cmdlet, I can easily compare the two and generate a delta report as shown in the image below. You can also decide to customize the generated report by injecting your own HTML into its header. To do so, simply specify the location of the HTML file to inject in the header of the report using the -HeaderFilePath parameter. The example shown in the following picture shows how to add your customer header to a delta report. Comparing a Configuration Against Another Tenant \u00b6 Using Microsoft365DSC, you can compare any configuration file against the current configuration of any other given Microsoft 365 tenant. This can be very useful in comparing the configuration between two tenants in scenarios like mergers and acquisitions. For example, let\u2019s assume you are trying to compare the configuration of Tenant A with the one from Tenant B. You can start by taking a snapshot of both tenants, and then use this feature to compare it against the configuration of Tenant B using the New-M365DSCDeltaReport cmdlet. Integrating with Azure DevOPS \u00b6 Microsoft365DSC takes all its sense when used as part of DevOPS processes within the enterprise. You can use it to automate your Microsoft 365 Change Management process so that any requested configuration changes to tenants get tracked via systems like Azure DevOPS and GitHub and use them to automate the deployment of your changes across your various tenants when a change is approved. While this article doesn\u2019t cover the process of integrating Microsoft365DSC with these systems, our team has written a great whitepaper to help you get started with integrating Microsoft365DSC with Azure DevOPS. Support \u00b6 As mentioned at the beginning of this document, Microsoft365DSC is an open-source solution led by Microsoft engineers and maintained by the community. This means that it is not supported via Microsoft's support. If you need help getting started, need to report a bug or request new features to be added, you will need to use the Issues section of the official GitHub repository to do so. The team is meeting on a weekly basis to review items and prioritize fixes. If you require immediate attention for a blocking issue and that you have a Premiere or Unified support contract with Microsoft, you can always talk to your account team to leverage hours in your contract to have an engineer assigned to expedite the process. Telemetry \u00b6 By default, Microsoft365DSC is sending telemetry back to Microsoft to help the team improve the solution in a pro-active manner. Information is all captured using Azure Application Insights. We are capturing information about what operations are being called the more often, information about any errors encountered, authentication type most commonly used, PowerShell versions used, etc. Users can decide to stop sending telemetry back to Microsoft at any given point by opting out. To do so, simply run the following PowerShell command: Set-M365DSCTelemetryOption -Enabled $false Note that this is a per machine setting. Therefore, if you are executing Microsoft365DSC on different systems within your organization, this command will have to be executed on each one. Organizations can also decide to capture telemetry from Microsoft365DSC using their own Application Insights account (without sending any data back to Microsoft). The Set-M365DSCTelemetryOption cmdlet lets you specify what Application Insights account you wish to send telemetry back to using the -InstrumentationKey parameter. Users can also specify a custom name for their solution using the -ProjectName parameter. This will ensure that every telemetry reported back to the Application Insights account gets tagged with the project name under customDimensions.ProjectName .","title":"Get Started"}]}
